# Picture to Poetry Converter #
For anyone who wants to find quick and easy computer-generated inspiration for their writing/poetry.

## Overview ##
This app allows the user to upload any image and be provided with an automatically generated 'stream of consciousness' poem. Each image adds a 'stanza' to the poem. Experiment and see if you find any surprising results!

## How to Get Started ##
```
npm install
npm run server
npm start
```

You must also obtain a Google Vision API KEY - which will be a JSON file - by following these steps:

[https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/before-you-begin](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/before-you-begin)

You will then need to add the filepath to that JSON file in an .env file. There is a .sample.env file with all required variables for guidance.

Once set up, the app is as simple as can be: just upload an image and the rest is on us.

This is a free and open source project. Feel free to take the ideas applied here and run with them â€” maybe even in a more useful and practical direction!
